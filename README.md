# MediScan


MediScan is an innovative health-focused web application that allows users to scan medicines to discover their uses and learn about potential side effects or reactions from excessive usage. Additionally, the platform provides a smart symptom checker where users can input their symptoms and receive valid health recommendations.

Features
Medicine Scanning
Upload or enter the name of any medicine to view its uses, precautions, and other relevant information.

Side Effects Detection
Understand the possible consequences of medicine overuse or incorrect dosage.

Symptom-Based Suggestions
Input symptoms in plain language and get likely conditions with advice on what to do next.

Real-Time Recommendations
Receive instant, relevant suggestions for minor conditions and guidance on when to consult a medical professional.

Tech Stack
HTML for structure

CSS for styling and responsive layout

JavaScript for core functionality and interactivity

TypeScript for better type safety and scalable development

Getting Started
To run the MediScan project locally:

Clone the repository

Open the project folder in your code editor

Launch index.html in your browser

Ensure you have a local or hosted backend API (if used) for medicine recognition and symptom analysis

Folder Structure
/src – contains main HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript files

/assets – images, icons, and fonts

/data – JSON or static files for demo data (optional)

/dist – compiled and optimized TypeScript output (if using a bundler)

How It Works
Users scan or search for a medicine to fetch its use-cases and possible side effects

A built-in symptom input system analyzes user queries and returns health suggestions

The application provides actionable advice or warns users about potential risks

Future Enhancements
Integration with a live medical database or API

Speech-to-text for symptom input

User authentication and health history tracking

Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline access
